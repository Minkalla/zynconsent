Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of Minkalla and our users very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as quickly as possible. Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue.

How to Report:

Email: Send an email to security@minkalla.org (or a placeholder email if minkalla.org isn't set up yet, e.g., your_personal_email@example.com with a clear note that this is temporary).

Encryption (Optional but Recommended): If you have a PGP key, please use it to encrypt your email for sensitive information. We will provide a public PGP key on our official website or GitHub profile once established.

Information to Include:

A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.

Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (including code snippets, screenshots, or videos if applicable).

The affected version(s) of the project.

The potential impact of the vulnerability.

Any suggested mitigations or fixes (if you have them).

Our Commitment
We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days.

We will provide a more detailed response and an estimated timeline for remediation within 7 business days of the initial acknowledgment.

We will keep you informed of our progress.

Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will notify you and, with your permission, acknowledge your contribution publicly (e.g., in release notes, a security advisory, or a dedicated security page).

Thank you for helping us keep Minkalla secure!

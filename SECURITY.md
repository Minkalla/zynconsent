# Security Policy for Minkalla ZynConsent

This document outlines security procedures and guidelines for the Minkalla ZynConsent project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Minkalla project team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any potential security issues.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, we ask you to report potential vulnerabilities privately via email to:

**`security@minkalla.com`**

Please include the following information in your report:

* **A clear and concise description of the vulnerability:** What is the issue?
* **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed instructions to reliably reproduce the issue.
* **Impact:** What is the potential impact or consequence of the vulnerability? (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access, denial of service).
* **Affected versions:** Which versions or commits of Minkalla ZynConsent are affected?
* **Your contact information (optional):** If you wish to be credited for the discovery.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.

## Our Security Process

Once a security vulnerability report is received, our process is as follows:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge your report via email within 3 business days, confirming receipt.
2.  **Investigation:** The Minkalla team will investigate the reported vulnerability thoroughly. This includes validating the report, assessing its impact, and identifying affected components.
3.  **Resolution & Fix:** If a vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on developing a fix.
4.  **Disclosure (Private):** We may engage in private discussions with the reporter to clarify details or confirm the fix.
5.  **Public Disclosure:** Once the fix is ready, and a reasonable timeframe for patching has passed (or upon a coordinated disclosure date), we will publish a security advisory (e.g., via GitHub Security Advisories or a blog post). We will credit the reporter if they wish.

We strive to provide regular updates throughout this process.

## Supported Versions

At this MVP stage, we currently provide security updates for the following version:

* **`main` branch:** The latest state of the `main` branch.

Any other branches or older versions are not officially supported for security updates.

## Best Practices

* Keep your Codespaces and local development environments updated.
* Regularly check for updates to third-party dependencies used in this project.
* Follow secure coding practices when contributing new features.

Thank you for helping keep Minkalla secure!
